## PRA (Path Ranking Algorithm) and SFE (Subgraph Feature Extraction)

This repo is forked from Matt Gardner's [pra code](https://github.com/matt-gardner/pra). Modifications have been made 
to ensure the code runs smoothly. Support for new datasets have also been added. Below is a brief description of the 
code from the original repo:

PRA and SFE are algorithms that extract feature matrices from graphs, and use those feature
matrices to do link prediction in that graph.  This repository contains implementations of PRA and
SFE, as used in the following papers (among others):

* Efficient and Expressive Knowledge Base Completion Using Subgraph Feature Extraction.  Matt
  Gardner and Tom Mitchell.  EMNLP 2015. ([website](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2015_sfe))
* Incorporating Vector Space Similarity in Random Walk Inference over Knowledge Bases.  Matt
  Gardner, Partha Talukdar, Jayant Krishnamurthy, and Tom Mitchell.  EMNLP 2014.
([website](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2014_vector_space_pra))
* Improving Learning and Inference in a Large Knowledge-base using Latent Syntactic Cues.  Matt
  Gardner, Partha Talukdar, Bryan Kisiel, and Tom Mitchell.  EMNLP 2013.
([website](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2013_pra))

To reproduce the experiments in those papers, see the corresponding website.  Note that the EMNLP
2015 paper has the most detailed instructions, and the older papers use versions of the code that
aren't compatible with the current repository.

See [the github.io page](http://matt-gardner.github.io/pra/) for code documentation.

## Dependencies:
This repo is written in Scala. Scala uses sbt as its main build tool. You can download sbt 
[here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html). Once you have sbt installed and in your shellâ€™s PATH, you can run 
the following commands to clone the repository and run the tests, verifying that things are working correctly:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matt-gardner/pra
cd pra
sbt test
```
If the end output is something like the following, you can be confident that everything is set up properly:
```bash
/home/mg1/clone/pra$ sbt test
[info] Loading global plugins from /usr0/home/mg1/.sbt/0.13/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /usr0/home/mg1/clone/pra/project
[info] Set current project to pra (in build file:/usr0/home/mg1/clone/pra/)
[... a lot of output from the tests ...]
[info] Passed: Total 65, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 65
[success] Total time: 2 s, completed Sep 29, 2014 5:11:42 PM
```


## Memory Requirement

This code takes quite a bit of memory. On NELL graphs, the code can easily use upwards of **40GB**. 
To set the maximum heap size for running the code, change `javaOptions in run ++= Seq("-Xmx40g")` 
in `build.sbt`.

## Quick Start
To quickly reproduce the best result from the EMNLP 2015 paper, run the following commands: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matt-gardner/pra.git
cd pra/examples
wget http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2015_sfe/graph.tgz
mkdir -p graphs/nell/
tar -xzf graph.tgz
mv kb_svo/ graphs/nell/
wget http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2015_sfe/split.tgz
mkdir splits/
tar -xzf split.tgz
mv final_nell_split_with_negatives/ splits/
wget http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/emnlp2015_sfe/nell_metadata.tgz
mkdir relation_metadata/
tar -xzf nell_metadata.tgz
mv nell/ relation_metadata/
cd ..
sbt "run ./examples/ sfe_bfs_pra_anyrel"
```
You will need to run the last command twice, incidentally - the first time, you should select the `ExperimentRunner` 
option, and the second time you should select `ExperimentScorer`, to see the results.
